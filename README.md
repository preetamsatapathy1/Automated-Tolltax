# Automated-Tolltax
In the initial part of the code we have imported various libraries.
Next we assign various phone numbers, name and amount of prepaid balance in the users account. Then the code is modified such a way that the RFID wont recognize the same vehicle twice at a toll tax booth. 
After reading the RFID tag reader a particular amount is deducted from the prepaid account and the phone number is fetched and message is sent to use. 
In case of complete exhaustion of prepaid account or in case of an unknown vehicle entry the buzzer is turned on and the user is requested to pay back.
